The objective of this project is to analyze the current job market trends and identify the most in-demand jobs, skills, and responsibilities based on 1.3 million LinkedIn job postings scraped in the year 2024. By leveraging this dataset, we aim to provide valuable insights to job seekers, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding their job search strategies and upskilling efforts. Specifically, we will focus on uncovering the top jobs, skills, and job responsibilities across various locations, industries, companies, and their organizational positions.
